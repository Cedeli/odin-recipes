        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Native to the Southern Luzon region of the Philippines, Bulalo is a light colored soup that's made rich by 
            cooking beef shanks and beef marrow bones for hours, until much of the collagen and fat has melted into the 
            clear broth.
