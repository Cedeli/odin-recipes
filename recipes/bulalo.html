        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Native to the Southern Luzon region of the Philippines, Bulalo is a light colored soup that's made rich by 
            cooking beef shanks and beef marrow bones for hours, until much of the collagen and fat has melted into the 
            clear broth.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Beef Marrow Bones</li>
            <li>1 Pound Beef Shank</li>
            <li>1 Quarterd Onion</li>
            <li>3 Cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Black Peppercorns</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoon Fish Sauce</li>
            <li>Salt to Taste</li>
            <li>2 Cobs Corn</li>
            <li>1 Peeled and Cubed Chayote</li>
            <li>3 Baby Bok Choy (leaves separated)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Boil a large pot of water. Add the marrow bones and beef shank and return to a boil. Continue boiling until 
                you don't see any more red blood coming from the meat or bones (about 10 minutes), then remove the meat and 
                bones with tongs and scrub under cold water to remove any scum. Dump the water in the pot out and rinse the 
                pot. This process rids the meat of excess blood and will ensure your soup is nice and clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return the cleaned meat and bones to the pot then add the onion, garlic, peppercorns and patis. Cover with 
                water then bring it to a rolling boil and skim off any scum that accumulates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the heat to medium low. If you are using a pressure cooker, afix the lid and let it cook for 1 Â½ hours. 
                If you're not using a pressure cooker, simmer until the meat on the shank is fork tender (4-5 hours). Skim off 
                any excessive fat from the top but do not remove it all (remember, fat=flavour). Transfer the meat and bones to 
                a bowl, then strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve, discard the solids then return the meat and bones to the 
                strained stock.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the corn and chayote and simmer for another 20 minutes or until the chayote is tender. Salt to taste, then add 
                the bok choy at the last minute. Serve with rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
