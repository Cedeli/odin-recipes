    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice garlic and onion into tiny pieces. Place them in a pressure cooker or a regular cooking pot and 
        then saute them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pork shanks, fish sauce, and ground black pepper. Cook pork shanks until slightly brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add water and then close the pressure cooker with its lid. Let it tenderize the pork shank.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the string beans, banana blossom, eggplant, and bok choy. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook both sides of the sliced eggplants until slightly brown. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blanche bok choy for 30 to 45 seconds; and then blanche string beans from 60 to 75 seconds. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil banana blossom until slightly soft. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soak annatto seeds in a small bowl filled with water and then add that water into the pressure cooker 
        once the pork shanks are tender. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt, shrimp paste, peanut butter, and crushed peanuts into the pressure cooker. Mix them altogether 
        and then let it simmer until sauce thickens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour slurry, which is a mixture made up of cornstarch and cold water, into the pressure cooker. Mix 
        it altogether and then let it simmer for a while again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the string beans, eggplants, bok choy, and banana blossom that you have set aside in a bowl or a plate. 
        Add the pork shanks and sauce to that bowl or plate. Serve the Kare-Kareng Pata.
